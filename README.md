## Introduction

The main idea of this project is to classify people into their Myers-Briggs Type Index (MBTI) personality type (output) based on text samples (input) from their posts in social media, employing Machine Learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression and XGBoost, and Deep Learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers and evaluating the accuracy of these models and their ability to predict the Myers-Briggs Personality Indicator. In other words, we will work on building models in order to detect a person’s personality type in connection to his style of writing. Focusing on the business aspect of the project, we are mainly aiming at two ends. Firstly, to provide a solution that will improve the performance of online marketing, since, identifying personality types will help companies to build more efficient targeted campaigns reducing the advertising costs and increasing their revenues at the same time. Secondly, we want to assess how reliable are these tests in the process of evaluation of a particular candidate’s personality by theirs answers in these type of assessments. Generally, we wanted to build a more generalizable system that can incorporate meaning of writing to determine overall personality types.
